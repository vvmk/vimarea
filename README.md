# vimarea

This repo is reserved for eventual development of a drop-in vim-enabled
<textarea> element. I believe this has been done/attempted before, but
I have yet to come upon a satisfying implementation. I don't need 100%
Vim experience, I just want to be able to drop something into a site
I'm developing and have at least basic Vim functionality available
as an option, with a little toggle switch on top. Similar to sites that
offer a 'dark mode', I want a vim-user to feel welcome and know their
feelings were considered on any site I create.

Code wars is a great example of this. It's not a deal-breaker, but it 
feels nice. That's not so much to ask, right?
